ASMXXX - Multi-Target Cross Assembler

Portions Copyright Alan R. Baldwin - see asxxxx_readme.txt

This project is a fork of Alan Baldwin's excellent
ASXXXX multi-target cross assembler.  It is multi-target
as it supports multiple targets.  It is a cross assembler
because it can assemble code for processors other than the
one it is running on.

The fork takes the following approach:
1/ Target building for linux/posix only.
2/ Remove non-core projects and other files.
3/ Add support for new processors, the first
    being the NEC 78K3.
