Upload of Alan Baldwin's excellent ASXXXX Assembler/Linker package.

This is with Alan's blessing and support, the intention being to broaden the development adding new targets and features, readily accessible from a public repository.  The goal, one day, is to have this project and my other project - dasmxx - play nicely together.

The original ASXXXX project is released under the GPL v3 license, and this package follows this convention as is required.

You will note that the name of this project is slightly different in order to differentiate it from Alan's own project.  This is intentional - if you want the original ASXXXX source, including the latest version, please check out the ASXXXX project page:
